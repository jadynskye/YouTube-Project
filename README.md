YouTube Homepage Recreation ðŸŽ¥

For this project I built a responsive front-end clone of YouTubeâ€™s homepage using HTML5 and CSS3. I implemented all of my favorite YouTube videos from many years of watching. This project helped me practice layout, positioning, and responsiveness while experimenting with multiple CSS features. This project is my biggest one up to this date and I found it super fun to work and learn front-end programming. For my next project I will make sure to now learn JavaScript and more of Python to implement backend with front-end.

What I Implemented

	â€¢	Responsive Design â†’ I used media queries to adjust the video grid layout for different screen sizes, making the page mobile-friendly.
	â€¢	CSS Grid â†’ I structured the video previews in a clean grid layout that dynamically changes from 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 columns depending on the screen width.
	â€¢	Nested Flexbox â†’ I used flexbox inside sections like the header, sidebar, and video info to align icons, text, and buttons.
	â€¢	Positioning (absolute & relative) â†’ I positioned elements like the header, sidebar, and video timestamps to overlay correctly and stay fixed when scrolling.
	â€¢	Hover Effects & Tooltips â†’ I added hover states for sidebar links, buttons, and tooltips to give the design an interactive feel.
	â€¢	Consistent Styling â†’ I styled elements with the Roboto font, consistent spacing, and color palette to mimic the YouTube UI.
